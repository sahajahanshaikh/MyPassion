My name is Sk Sahajahan.
I am working with Keen Able from 5 years.
My Passions are listining music and supporting anybody in IT related issue.
These are two things i do regularly. When i am not in my work, i am happy to help my fellow engineers and help to get resolution.
My working productivity is better when i am listining music. I prefer music with low volume at work or when i was studied math and it's make to focus on problem and resolve them.
I feel happy when someone come to me with an issue and get the resolution. I saw their smile which makes me realy happy.
